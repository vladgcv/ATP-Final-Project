This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

csv_path <- "table_none.csv"
raw <- read_csv(csv_path, skip = 6, show_col_types = FALSE)

unique_cars <- unique(raw$number.of.cars)

for (n in unique_cars) {
  df <- filter(raw, number_of_cars == n)
  
  p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = ticks, y = avg.speed)) +
    geom_line(color = "red", alpha = 0.6) +
    geom_smooth(se = TRUE, color = "black") +
    labs(
      title = paste("Average Speed for", n, "Cars"),
      x = "Time steps",
      y = "Average speed"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
  
  print(p)  # Show in RStudio Viewer
  
  # Optional: save to file
  ggsave(paste0("avg_speed_", n, "_cars.png"), p, width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)
}


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
